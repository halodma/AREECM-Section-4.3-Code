# Armstrong's Range Exponent Electron Configuration Model (AREECM)
Armstrong's Range Exponent Electron Configuration Model (AREECM) is new electron notation, the preprint is available on chemrxiv at: https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-jq84z-v3


# What The Code does
- AREECM_Code.py allows users to extract information out of the AREECM python dictionary and perform calculations based around AREECM notation.
- areecm_digital_dictionary_python.py is table 3 found on the preprint and OSF that has been recreated in python to allow users to use AREECM notation in code
